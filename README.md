# advanced-lca-notebooks
Notebooks used in the advanced LCA course (plus others)

These notebooks introduce to the use of the [Brightway2](https://2.docs.brightway.dev/index.html) LCA software. They ahve been used in multiple editions of the Advanced LCA course at Aalborg University. More primitive versions are available at the [B4B](https://github.com/massimopizzol/B4B) repository.

Videos explaining the notebooks are available at [my blog](https://moutreach.science/) together with other introductory LCA teaching videos.

**Disclaimer**: note that both the notebooks and the videos are de-contextualized from the teaching activities that usually integrate them. This teaching activities usually include exercises, Q&A, and more extensive explanations. Therefore, even though most of them can work as a stand-alone resource they were not initially designed as such.
