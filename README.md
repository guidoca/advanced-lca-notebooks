Notebooks used in the advanced LCA course (plus others)

These notebooks introduce to the use of the [Brightway2](https://2.docs.brightway.dev/index.html) LCA software. They ahve been used in multiple editions of the Advanced LCA course at Aalborg University.

Videos explaining the notebooks are available at [my blog](https://moutreach.science/) together with other introductory LCA teaching videos.
